Genetic Networks

### Description

Genetic criticism is a field of stufy dealing with the genesis of literary works. Some of the objects of study of genetic criticism have been formally modelled, in particular the authors' manuscripts that can be represented in XML-TEI. The relationships between the genetic witnesses, however, haven't been pursued from the point of view of formal modelling, thus no computational analysis has been applied to them until now.

The relationships between genetic witnesses can be varied: scholars use to gather drafts, plans and notes for a work in a genetic dossier, calling all these witnesses *avant-textes*. Inside the dossier, the *avant-textes* are organized in chronological order. The notion of *avant-texte*, however, does not cover all possible genetic activities, since, as scholars recently pointed out, the composition might continue after the first publication and might start before the composition of a plan.

Genetic criticism notions can be used in organizing materials for a scholarly edition. This is the case for the edition of the complete works of Gustave Roud. In the practice of this Swiss writer, we don't find a straightforward path, from a plan to a final manuscript, but a complex network of texts that are reused and reassembled, from the diary to the publications.

### Example 1
The diary note "Missy11 h et demie" (CLSR GR MS 4 A/3a) is copied in a diary notebook as "Missy 11 h et 1/2 soir" (CLSR GR MS 4 A/1a). This note is reused in "Cendre", published in the periodical Aujourd'hui on the 10th of July 1930. This article is partially used in "Air de la solitude", book published in 1945.

### Example 2
The two articles of literary criticism about the writer Catherine Colomb, "Catherine Colomb, romancière vaudoise" and "Notre monde périssable sauvé par la poésie", published in 1956 and 1965 in the periodical Gazette de Lausanne, are reused in the making of the preface to the complete works of Catherine Colomb, published in 1968.
